# Benchmark Harness (Scaffold)

This directory intentionally contains a scaffold only. Model integration is expected to be added
by consumers of the corpus.

High-accuracy benchmarking requires recording:
- corpus_version
- question set version
- persona file hash/version
- harness git SHA
- model identifier and generation parameters
- retrieval configuration (if any)
