# Dist Artifacts Policy

`dist/` stores tracked corpus release artifacts.

## Layout

- `dist/releases/<version>/` contains immutable release snapshots.
- `dist/latest/` mirrors the latest released snapshot.

## Update policy

Release artifacts are generated by `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
Do not manually edit files under `dist/releases/` or `dist/latest/`.
Local development builds should use `dist/dev-local/` (gitignored).

## Retention

Release snapshots are retained in git history by version for reproducible audits.
