# SaaS pricing model options

## Common models

- **Seat-based**: predictable revenue, but may penalize broad adoption inside customer orgs.
- **Usage-based**: aligns price to value, but requires accurate metering and can increase revenue volatility.
- **Hybrid**: can balance predictability and value alignment, but increases complexity.

## Risks

- Pricing complexity can reduce conversion if buyers cannot estimate total cost.
- Poor metering and unclear units can create trust issues.

## Decision criteria

Choose pricing based on:
- the unit of value delivered
- buyer predictability needs
- cost-to-serve drivers
