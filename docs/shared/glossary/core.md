# Core glossary for the corpus

## Taxonomy

A controlled vocabulary of allowed values (domains, status, audiences, tags) used to keep documents consistent and machine-filterable.

## Corpus snapshot

A tagged, immutable export of the validated source material (e.g., `corpus-v2026.02.0`) used for reproducible ingestion and benchmarking.

## Deterministic chunking

A stable, rule-driven method of splitting documents into chunks so that retrieval and citations remain consistent across builds.
